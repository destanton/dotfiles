# Dotfiles 

I started this `dotfile` collection to ease the burden of setting up new systems from scratch. I didn't want to rely on a full system backup just to keep my programming workflow. Plus, I thought it would be a good way to dig into Linux, ZSH, etc.


It's still very much a work in progress.
